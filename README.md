#  Neural Network Based on TVM
Cong Ding's course project of *Compiler Design* in 2019 Spring, lectured by [Prof. Yun (Eric) Liang](http://ceca.pku.edu.cn/en/people_/faculty_/yun_liang/).

## Part 1: Warm-up Project
Use tvm to implement five operators of conventional nerual networks.

Check my implementation in folder "Part1".

The testing framework is published [here](https://github.com/KnowingNothing/compiler_assignment).

Due: April 24, 2019

## Part 2: Final Project

Use tvm to optimize two operators: GEMM and Conv2d.

I completed the project with my teammate Jiawei Wu. Check our implementation in folder "Part2".

The testing machine and usage are published [here](https://github.com/HolyLow/tvm_docker/blob/master/ssh_tvm/README.md).
